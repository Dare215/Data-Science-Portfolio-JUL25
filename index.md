## 🧠 About

I’m a graduate student pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Bellevue University, with a focus on automation, machine learning, and healthcare innovation and data science. My research has explored global space exploration, hallucination reduction in LLMs, and crime data prediction. I plan to pursue a PhD in AI, aiming to improve diagnostics and planetary research through advanced models.
